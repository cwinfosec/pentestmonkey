# Pentestmonkey - ReadMe
This is an archive of pentestmonkey.net cheat sheets in case the site goes away permanently. It appears the pentestmonkey.net domain expired on July 2, 2019, and I personally do not know if it's going to come back. Thank you for all of your contributions to infosec, pentestmonkey. For the time being, this is merely going to be an archive of his very popular cheat sheets.

I will try to scrape as much as I can here, but your best resource for viewing any of pentestmonkey's writings - until/if it comes back up - is going to be at this location: https://web.archive.org/web/20180425125720/http://pentestmonkey.net/
