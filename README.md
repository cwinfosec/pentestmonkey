# Pentestmonkey - ReadMe
This is an archive of pentestmonkey.net cheat sheets in case the site goes away permanently. It appears the pentestmonkey.net domain expired on July 2, 2019, and I personally do not know if it's going to come back. For the time being, this is merely going to be an archive of his very popular cheat sheets.

I will try to scrape as much as I can here, but your best resource for viewing any of pentestmonkey's writings - until/if their site comes back up - is going to be at this location: https://web.archive.org/web/20180425125720/http://pentestmonkey.net/

Thank you for all of your contributions to infosec, pentestmonkey. Your work has been greatly appreciated by many people around the world.

Update July 12, 2019: https://pentestmonkey.net is back online.
